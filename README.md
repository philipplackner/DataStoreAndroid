# DataSource Usage Demo

This is a demo project which using DataSource to save data.

> Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers). DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
>
> If you're currently using [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/content/SharedPreferences) to store data, consider migrating to DataStore instead.

This is the information from Android developer website



In the project, we create 2 edit text to get the user inputï¼š

1. dataStore key EditText
    + which equals to SharedPreferences key
2. dataStore value EditText
    + which equals to SharedPreferences value

in the demo case, we just using write and read `String` value as examples, DataStore can store those values:

+ String
+ Int
+ Float
+ Long
+ Boolean
+ Double
+ `Set<String>`

this support data type was declared in `PreferencesKeys.kt` files using Kotlin extends functions.
